\section{A note of caution}{

 Stop words are an arbitrary choice imposed by the
  user, and accessing a pre-defined list of words to ignore does not mean
  that it will perfectly fit your needs. You are strongly encourged to
  inspect the list and to make sure it fits your particular requirements.  The 
  built-in English stopword list does not contain "will", for instance, because
  of its multiple meanings, but you might want to include this word for your
  own application.
