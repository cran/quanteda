## How a quanteda corpus works

Describe the object, how the goal is to store unchanged, original texts, whose
only processing has been to convert their encoding to a common format.

A quanteda corpus can store settings, metadata, document variables, and be indexed.  It can be linked
to dictionaries, collocation lists, and custom stop words.

## Currently available corpus sources

quanteda has tools for getting texts into a corpus from a variety of sources: 

* a character object (a vector of class `character`) already loaded into R;
* a directory of text files;
* an Excel spreadsheet;
* a comma-separated value file;
* data from the Facebook API, in JSON format;
* data from the Twitter API, in JSON format;
* a `VCorpus` corpus object from the **tm** package.

### From a character object already in memory

The simplest case is to create a corpus from a vector of texts already in memory in R.  This gives the advanced R user complete flexbility with his or her choice of text inputs, as there are almost endless
ways to get a vector of texts into R.

If we already have the texts in this form, we can call the corpus constructor function directly.  We can demonstrate this on the built-in character vector of 57 US president inaugural speeches called `inaugTexts`.
```{r}
str(inaugTexts)  # this gives us some information about the object
myCorpus <- corpus(inaugTexts)  # build the corpus
summary(myCorpus, n=5)
```

If we wanted, we could add some document-level variables -- what quanteda calls `docvars` -- to this corpus.
We can do this using the R's `substring()` function to extract characters from a name -- in this case, the 
name of the character vector `inaugTexts`.  This works using our fixed starting and ending positions with
`substring()` because these names are a very regular format of `YYYY-PresidentName`.
```{r}
docvars(myCorpus, "President") <- substring(names(inaugTexts), 6)
docvars(myCorpus, "Year") <- as.integer(substring(names(inaugTexts), 1, 4))
summary(myCorpus, n=5)
```

If we wanted to tag each document with additional meta-data not considered a document variable of interest for
analysis, but rather something that we need to know as an attribute of the document, we could also 
add those to our corpus.
```{r}
language(myCorpus) <- "english"
metadoc(myCorpus, "docsource")  <- paste("inaugTexts", 1:ndoc(myCorpus), sep="_")
summary(myCorpus, n=5, showmeta=TRUE)
```

The last command, `metadoc`, allows you to define your own document meta-data fields.  The two docmeta fields
`language` and `encoding` are so common that quanteda has shortened accessor and replacement functions
for manipulating these: `encoding()` and `language()`.  Note that in assiging just the single value of `"english"`, R has recycled the value until it matches the number of documents in the corpus.  In creating
a simple tag for our custom metadoc field `docsource`, we used the quanteda function `ndoc()` to retrieve
the number of documents in our corpus.  This function is deliberately designed to work in a way similar to 
functions you may already use in R, such as `nrow()` and `ncol()`.


## Tools for handling corpus objects

### Adding two corpus objects together

The `+` operator provides a simple method for concatenating two corpus objects.  If they contain
different sets of document-level variables, these will be stitched together in a fashion that guarantees
that no information is lost.  Corpus-level medata data is also concatenated.
```{r}
library(quanteda)
mycorpus1 <- corpus(inaugTexts[1:5], note="First five inaug speeches")
mycorpus2 <- corpus(inaugTexts[6:10], note="Next five inaug speeches")
mycorpus3 <- mycorpus1 + mycorpus2
summary(mycorpus3)
```

## Creating a corpus fr


Often, texts aren't available as pre-made R character vectors, and we need to load them from an external source.
To do this, we first create a *source* for the documents, which defines how they are loaded from the source into the corpus. The source may be a character vector, a directory of text files, a zip file, a twitter search, or several external package formats such as `tm`'s `VCorpus`.

Once a source has been defined, we make a new corpus by calling the `corpus` constructor with the source as the first argument. The corpus constructor also accepts arguments which can set some corpus metadata, and define how the document variables are set.

### From a directory of files

A very common source of files for creating
a corpus will be a set of text files found on a local (or remote)
directory. To load texts in this way, we first define a source for the directory, and pass this source as an argument to the corpus constructor. We create a directory source by calling the `directory` function. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
# Basic file import from directory
d <- directory('~/Dropbox/QUANTESS/corpora/inaugural')
myCorpus <- corpus(d)
```

If the document variables are specified in the filenames of the texts, we can read them by setting the `docvarsfrom` argument (`docvarsfrom = "filenames"`) and specifiying how the filenames are formatted with the `sep` argument. For example, if the inaugural address texts were stored on disk in the format `Year-President.txt` (e.g. `1973-Nixon.txt`), then we can load them and automatically populate the document variables. The `docvarnames` argument sets the names of the document variables --- it must be the same length as the parts of the filenames.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# File import reading document variables from filenames
d <- directory('~/Dropbox/QUANTESS/corpora/inaugural')

# In this example the format of the filenames is `Year-President.txt`. 
# Because there are two variables in the filename, docvarnames must contain two names
myCorpus <- corpus(d, docvarsfrom="filenames", sep="-", docvarnames=c("Year", "President") )
```

### From a twitter search

`quanteda` provides an interface to retrieve and store data from a twitter search as a corpus object. The REST API query uses the [twitteR package](https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR), and an API authorization from twitter is required. The process of obtaining this authorization is described in detail here: <https://openhatch.org/wiki/Community_Data_Science_Workshops/Twitter_authentication_setup>, correct as of October 2014. The twitter API is a commercial service, and rate limits and the data returned are determined by twitter.

Four keys are required, to be passed to `quanteda`'s `getTweets` source function, in addition to the search query term and the number of results required. The maximum number of results that can be obtained is not exactly identified in the API documentation, but experimentation indicates an upper bound of around 1500 results from a single query, with a frequency limit of one query per minute.

The code below performs authentication and runs a search for the string 'quantitative'. Many other functions for working with the API are available from the [twitteR package](https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR). An R interface to the streaming API is also available [link](link).

```{r eval=FALSE}
# These keys are examples and may not work! Get your own key at dev.twitter.com
consumer_key="vRLy03ef6OFAZB7oCL4jA"
consumer_secret="wWF35Lr1raBrPerVHSDyRftv8qB1H7ltV0T3Srb3s"
access_token="1577780816-wVbOZEED8KZs70PwJ2q5ld2w9CcvcZ2kC6gPnAo"
token_secret="IeC6iYlgUK9csWiP524Jb4UNM8RtQmHyetLi9NZrkJA"


tw <- getTweets('quantitative', numResults=20, consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, token_secret)
```

The return value from the above query is a source object which can be passed to quanteda's corpus constructor, and the document variables are set to correspond with tweet metadata returned by the API.

```{r eval=FALSE}
twCorpus <- corpus(tw)
names(docvars(twCorpus))
```
